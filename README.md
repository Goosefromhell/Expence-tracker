Simple(and very bad) CLI expense trakcer
- Add custom expenses
- Change them
- Or Delete them  
- See all of them
- See amount of money spent in month or totally

If you somehow want to set up this git clone it and then:

  1. Go to the task-manager-CLI directory and run: ``` mvn clean package -v ```
  2. Then run the program with:  ``` java -jar target/Expence-tracker-1.0.jar <COMMAND> ``` Your first command will probably be ```--help``` .
      (Optionally, you can create a bash script or exe idc)
  3. If you still don’t get how to use it, try tarot cards. If that fails, try harder tarot cards
